Data [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-ruby.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)
----
A terminal data-controller with dynamic auto-complete features, that is built with ruby. You may want to even store credentials such as Bank Account / Password details - however, do this is at your own risk as anyone who has your unlocked linux machine / has SSH-access to your linux machine can navigate to the `info/` directory generated by the codes, to view all the data. 

INSTALLING REQUIRED GEMS

<br> (1) `gem install json`
