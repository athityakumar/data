Data [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-ruby.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)
----
A terminal data-controller with dynamic auto-complete features, that is built with ruby. You may want to even store credentials such as Bank Account / Password details - however, do this is at your own risk as anyone who has your unlocked linux machine / has SSH-access to your linux machine can navigate to the `info/` directory generated by the codes, to view all the data. 

INSTALLING REQUIRED GEMS
------------------------
<br> (1) `gem install json` 
<br> (2) `gem install terminal-table`

MAKING THE SCRIPT WORK
----------------------
<br> (1) Type the following commands on a terminal : `cd ~/; git clone git@github.com:athityakumar/data.git`
<br> (2) Install the required gems, as mentioned above. Tested on ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768)  version.
<br> (3) Now type this in the terminal : `gedit ~/.bashrc`
<br> (4) The shell-script found in this repository as `CopyThis.sh` must be copy-pasted into the `.bashrc` file.
<br> (5) Now, open a new terminal. Have the auto-completion files of `Data` been initialised? Great!
<br> (6) Type `D` and press `Tab`. Yay, it auto-completes to `Data`!  
<br> (7) Continue further by reading through the set of supported auto-complete commands.
